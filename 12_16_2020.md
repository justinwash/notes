# Dev Resources

So below you'll find a bunch of resources that should help you get started prior to joining up with launchcode, daugherty U, etc. Some of these I used, some are newer but look good.

I'm working off the assumption that you're looking for web development as a first foray into dev. I highly recommend this as I personally find it the most fun, though modern web dev doesn't just mean making pretty pages any more so you'll still get into databases, back-end, and other things that can carry you into more general computer science and other deeper data-focused pursuits if you so choose.

That said, here's what my own experience looked like:

* heard about launchcode, decided to do the thing
* mis-read the requirements and how it was supposed to work, thought I had to teach myself and bring in a project just to get started
* spend ~1 year learning from basics -> "full stack" web dev while applying what I learned to my project
* when I thought I was ready, contacted launchcode, filled out their 'self-learning roadmap' which I'm pretty sure doesn't exist anymore. they set me up with a pre-interview after looking at my project
* went to interview, they had me do some pseudo-code puzzles on a whiteboard.
* they called me ~2 weeks later and set me up with an interview at stifel
* ~2 weeks after that i was working there for $15/hour.

So if I were you I would do two things:

* Call Launchcode headquarters and see when the next signup for LC101 is. 
* When they most likely tell you its gonna be a few months, ask them if the self-learning path is still a viable one when looking to use them to find your first job. If they say yes, awesome, time to get started. If they say no, well, still time to get started, just know that the beginnings of LC101 will probably be ezpz if you're doing self learning between now and then.

I chatted with a few people at Daugherty about Daugherty University. All of them recommended having some basic skills under your belt (basically be able to write a simple note-taking app or something of the sort) before applying. You can do that here when you think you're ready, and I can put in a word: https://careers.daugherty.com/index.php/daugherty-university/

Now onto the good stuff:

* Big general everything list with toooonnns of info, and what will pretty much be your step-by-step guide to getting gud -- https://github.com/bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer

* Basically the same but a bit more interactive and hand-holding (this is not a bad thing) -- https://www.freecodecamp.org/

* Twitter for developers. Tons of great tutorials and stuff in here -- https://dev.to/

With just those you should really be set. Id recommend after each 'course' or section you learn, try to implement the thing they taught you yourself, or make changes to their code to see how it acts, in general just focus on learning deeply, not just getting on to the next section.

* Make yourself a github and learn how git works: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/ (then tell me your username so i can follow you )
